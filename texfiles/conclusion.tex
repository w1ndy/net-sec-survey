This survey briefly summarizes the evolving authentication technologies adopted in the Internet of Things framework in three aspects: application, architecture, and user authentication. The security of complex IoT networks will surely benefit from the implementation of an increasing number of authentication techniques. However, weaknesses were also observed in the prior authentication studies. Most of the state-of-the-art authentication techniques are limited to adapting existing cryptography methods or infrastructures from tranditional networks, rather than developing new techniques in the best interest of IoT networks. We are looking forward to seeing more novel and exciting ideas arised from the evolution of authentication techniques in the Internet of Things.
