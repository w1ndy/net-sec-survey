\IEEEtitleabstractindextext{%
\begin{abstract}
The Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been increasingly popular in the past few years, given the wide applicability in a variety of domains, including transportation, logistics, healthcare, smart environments, etc. However, the massive and distributed nature of Internet of Things also brings severe security issues along the way.
Authentication is one of the key technologies in traditional networks to address security and privacy concerns. With the evolution of Internet of Things networks, authentication technologies continue playing a significant role in the application, architecture, and user authentication of  Internet of Things.
This survey briefly presents the background of Internet of Things, describes the techniques proposed in three aforementioned types of authentication, and concludes the state of research in this area.
